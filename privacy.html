        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>At <strong>Nimo</strong>, your privacy is our priority. Our platform provides online games without ads, downloads, interruptions, or tracking. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information while you use our platform at <a href="http://nimogames.pages.dev" target="_blank">nimogames.pages.dev</a>.</p>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important Note:</strong> All games on Nimo are served through external links and may have their own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of individual game providers.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Nimo itself does not collect personal data, does not use cookies, and does not display ads. The platform is designed to be private and focused purely on gaming.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Game Links</h2>
        <p>All games on Nimo are hosted externally through <a href="https://nimogames.pages.dev/docs" target="_blank">third-party providers</a>. When you play games:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Games are loaded from external sources</li>
            <li>These external game providers may collect data according to their own privacy policies</li>
            <li>We have no control over the data collection practices of these third-party game hosts</li>
            <li>We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of individual game providers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no tracking, sharing, or advertising targeting. Any minimal technical data (like server logs) is used solely for maintaining and improving the platform's performance.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Nimo does <strong>not</strong> use cookies, third-party trackers, or advertising networks. However, external game providers may use their own cookies and tracking technologies.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We maintain basic security measures to ensure the platform runs smoothly, but since no personal information is collected, privacy risks are minimized. Please note that external game providers have their own security measures.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Nimo is not intended for children under 13 years old. Since we do not collect personal data, no information about children is stored. Parents should be aware that external game providers may have different age policies.</p>

        <h2>7. External Links Responsibility</h2>
        <p>Nimo serves as a gateway to external games. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or data collection of these third-party game providers. Users should exercise caution and review the privacy policies of external game sites.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Continued use of Nimo constitutes acceptance of any updates.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
